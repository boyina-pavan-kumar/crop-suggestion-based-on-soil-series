# crop-suggestion-based-on-soil-series
India is the land of agriculture and it is the major source of economy.70% of Indian population directly relies on agriculture. The common problem existing among the young Indian farmers is to choose the right crop based on the soil requirements. Due to This, they face a serious setback in productivity. Our work proposes to help farmers determine the soil quality by doing analysis on its various parameters and to suggest crops based on the results obtained using machine learning approach. In this we are using the machine learning algorithm such as Decision Tree Algorithm to improve the efficiency of Crop Suggestion System along with the powerful python library Scikit-Learn.
